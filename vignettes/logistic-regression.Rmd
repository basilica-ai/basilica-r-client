```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

In this example, we'll train a logistic regression to classify tweets using only
the natural language text found in these tweets. We'll only need about 800 tweets
per user account.

### Setup

To run this example, you will need the following packages.

```
install.packages("basilica", "dplyr", "ROCR")
```

## Step 1: Embedding all tweets

We'll use a collection of about 800 tweets from Bill Gates and Kanye West and
train a logistic regression to predict (given a tweet) which account the tweet
belongs to. In order to do that, we'll first load the tweets from the basilica
package.

    library(jsonlite)
    bill <- fromJSON(system.file("extdata/twitter/billgates.json", package="basilica"))
    kanye <- fromJSON(system.file("extdata/twitter/kanyewest.json", package="basilica"))

Now that we've loaded the JSON files, we can embedded the text of these tweets
using Basilica.

    library(basilica)
    connect("28c4dab5-27f1-52a7-508e-527dd234224c", "http://api.localhost:8000")

    embeddings <- rbind(embed_sentences(bill[, 7]), embed_sentences(kanye[, 7])) # 7 is the index of the text

## Step 2: Running PCA + Cleaning Data

Now that we have these embeddings, we'll want to run PCA and get the 100 features
that explain the most variance. We'll also add a column to the matrix with the 
corresponding category each tweet belongs to.

    pca <- prcomp(t(embeddings), center = TRUE,scale = TRUE)
    features <- pca$rotation[,1:100]

    type <- c(integer(dim(bill)[1]) + 1, integer(dim(kanye)[1]))
    features <- cbind(type, features)
    features <- data.frame(features[sample.int(nrow(features)),])

## Step 3: Training the model

Finally, we can now train our model. In order to do that we'll separate out the
data into training and test data.

    library(dplyr)
    train_data <- sample_frac(features, 0.8)
    train_index <- as.numeric(rownames(train_data))
    test_data <- features[-train_index, ]

    model <- glm(type ~ ., data = train_data, family = "binomial")

## Step 4: Verifying Results

After training the model, we can verify who well it's trained by taking a look at
the confusion matrix.

    predict <- predict(model, newdata=test_data, type = 'response')
    table(train_data$type, predict > 0.5)

    library(ROCR)
    ROCRpred <- prediction(predict, test_data$type)
    ROCRperf <- performance(ROCRpred, 'tpr','fpr')
    plot(ROCRperf, colorize = TRUE, text.adj = c(-0.2,1.7))

You have now trained a logistic regression with only the natural language text
of the tweets and 800 data points per category and getting an R squared of about `0.80`.
